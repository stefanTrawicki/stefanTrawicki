I’m Stefan, a machine learning and security researcher from the UK.

I work for (Founding ML Engineer) and helped build [Mindgard](https://mindgard.ai/), a first-of-its-kind security company for ML models and their deployments. I’m also a PhD researcher at Lancaster University in both the [Distributed Systems](https://eds.lancs.ac.uk/), and [Security Lancaster](https://ssg.lancs.ac.uk/people/) groups. My research can be found [here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/security-lancaster/about/all-staff/stefan-trawicki), and on [arxiv](https://arxiv.trawicki.io).

I graduated from Lancaster SCC in 2021, and have since taught SCC203 Networking, SCC211 Operating Systems, and SCC411 Big Data Systems.

Most of my time is spent learning about ML, both in theory and production. I work with attacks against ML models ranging from those targeting public API’s all the way down to execution signatures on bare metal. Currently, my focus is on ML compilation.

Being one of the founding team members of Mindgard also let me build up skills in NodeJS, React and their associated libraries in a full-stack capacity.
